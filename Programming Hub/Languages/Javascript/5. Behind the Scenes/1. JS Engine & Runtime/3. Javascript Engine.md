# JavaScript Engine: Inner Workings

## 1. Parsing
- Begins with the Parser meticulously examining every line of code.
- Breaks down the code into manageable tokens and constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Ensures code adheres to JavaScript syntax rules, catching errors before execution.

## 2. Interpretation
- Code encounters the Interpreter, translating intentions into actions.
- Executes code line by line, navigating through the AST.
- Orchestrates code's journey through the runtime environment.

## 3. Compilation (Optional)
- In engines like Google's V8, Compiler optimizes code through JIT compilation.
- Identifies hot paths and transforms them into optimized machine code.
- Enhances execution speed for better performance.

## 4. Memory Management
- Memory Heap provides a home for variables and objects.
- Manages memory allocation and deallocation efficiently.
- Ensures resources are utilized effectively and prevents memory leaks.

## 5. Execution Control
- Call Stack maintains execution context, tracking function calls.
- Guides code flow, ensuring correct order of execution.
- Orchestrates function invocation and return.

## 6.  Event Loop (Asynchronous Handling)
- Event Loop manages asynchronous operations in environments like the browser or Node.js.
- Guards against blocking operations, ensuring responsiveness.
- Monitors Call Stack and task queue for efficient task execution.

Through these steps, the JavaScript engine transforms code into dynamic experiences, powering the web and captivating users worldwide. Each component plays a crucial role, ensuring efficient and reliable code execution.
