1. Iterates over each element in an array.
2. Executes a function for each element.
3. Simplifies array iteration without manual index management.

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.forEach(function(currentValue, index, array) {
  // Your code here
});
```

**Parameters:**
- `function`: A function to execute on each element. It can take up to three arguments:
  - `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
  - `index` (optional): The index of the current element being processed.
  - `array` (optional): The array `forEach` was called upon.

**Return Value:**
- `undefined`: `forEach` does not return a value. It simply iterates over the array.
- It doesn't support `break` and `continue` over looping.

**Mutability:**
- Immutable: `forEach` does not mutate the array.

**Example:**
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(function(num) {
  console.log(num);
});
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

#### Comparison with `for` Loop and `for...of` Loop

**1. `for` Loop:**
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

**2. `for...of` Loop:**
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num);
}
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

#### Comparison and Real-World Use Cases

**When to Use `forEach`:**
- **Convenience:** Use `forEach` when you want a clean and concise way to iterate through each element of an array without manually managing indexes.
- **Readability:** It enhances code readability by clearly expressing the intent of iterating over each element.
- **Callback Operations:** Ideal for performing operations that require a callback function for each element, such as logging, transforming, or updating array elements.

**Real-World Use Case:**
Imagine you have an array of transactions in an e-commerce system, and you need to calculate the total amount of all transactions. Here's how you might use `forEach`:

```javascript
let transactions = [100.50, 75.25, 50.75, 120.30];
let totalAmount = 0;

transactions.forEach(function(transaction) {
  totalAmount += transaction;
});

console.log(`Total amount: $${totalAmount.toFixed(2)}`);
// Output: Total amount: $346.80
```

**Comparison Insights:**
- **`forEach` vs `for` Loop:** `forEach` simplifies code by handling iteration internally, whereas `for` loop requires manual index management.
- **`forEach` vs `for...of` Loop:** `forEach` is more concise for simple iterations with callbacks; `for...of` provides flexibility when needing access to both index and value.

**Conclusion:**
`forEach` is powerful for iterating over array elements, providing a clear and efficient way to perform operations on each element. It enhances code readability and reduces the potential for off-by-one errors compared to traditional `for` loops. Understanding its strengths and limitations helps in choosing the right approach based on specific programming needs and scenarios.

## Deep drive into `forEach`
#### forEach Method:
- **Purpose:** `forEach` is primarily used for iterating over elements in an array and performing actions or side effects for each element.
- **Callback Function:** A callback function is provided to `forEach`, which is executed once for each array element.
- **Return Value:** `forEach` does not return anything meaningful (returns `undefined`) and does not affect the original array or create a new array.

#### Example:

```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squares = [];

// Using forEach to calculate squared values and populate another array
numbers.forEach(function(number) {
  squares.push(number * number);
});

console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### Comparison with map Method:
- **Purpose:** `map` is used to transform each element of an array and return a new array with the transformed values.
- **Return Value:** `map` returns a new array populated with results of calling a provided function on every element of the calling array.

```javascript
// Using map to calculate squared values and return a new array
let squaredNumbers = numbers.map(function(number) {
  return number * number;
});

console.log(squaredNumbers); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### Comparison with filter Method:
- **Purpose:** `filter` is used to create a new array with elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
- **Return Value:** `filter` returns a new array containing elements that satisfy the condition specified in the callback function.

```javascript
// Using filter to return only even numbers from the array
let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(function(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
});

console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]
```

#### Comparison with reduce Method:
- **Purpose:** `reduce` applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array, resulting in a single value.
- **Return Value:** `reduce` returns a single value after reducing the array to a cumulative result.

```javascript
// Using reduce to calculate the sum of all elements in the array
let sum = numbers.reduce(function(accumulator, currentValue) {
  return accumulator + currentValue;
}, 0);

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

### Conclusion:
- **forEach** is suitable for iterating and performing side effects (like logging or modifying external variables).
- **map** is used for transforming elements and creating a new array with transformed values.
- **filter** is used for filtering elements based on a condition and creating a new array with filtered values.
- **reduce** is used for aggregating values and producing a single result from the array.
