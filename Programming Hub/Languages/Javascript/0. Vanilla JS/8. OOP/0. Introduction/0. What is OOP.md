Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that focuses on creating and using "objects," which are instances of defined templates called classes.
- It helps to organize our code.
- Flexible and easy to maintain.

### Key Concepts of OOP
1. **Class:**
   - A blueprint for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects will have.
   - Example: A `Car` class might have attributes like `color`, `make`, and `model`, and methods like `drive` and `stop`.

2. **Object:**
   - An instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object of that class is created.
   - Example: `const myCar = new Car('red', 'Toyota', 'Camry');` creates an object `myCar` of the `Car` class.

3. **Encapsulation:**
   - The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit or class. Encapsulation helps to keep data safe from outside interference and misuse.
   - Example: Attributes of a class can be made private to prevent unauthorized access.

4. **Inheritance:**
   - A mechanism where a new class (child class) inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reuse.
   - Example: A `SportsCar` class might inherit from the `Car` class but also have additional attributes like `topSpeed`.

5. **Polymorphism:**
   - The ability to present the same interface for different underlying forms (data types). It allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon.
   - Example: A `drive` method might perform differently depending on whether it is called by a `Car` object or a `Bike` object.

6. **Abstraction:**
   - The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object.
   - Example: You can use the `drive` method of the `Car` class without knowing the intricate details of how the engine works.
