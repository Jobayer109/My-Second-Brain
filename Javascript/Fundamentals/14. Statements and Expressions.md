## Statements
- A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
- A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements.
- The statement ends with a semicolon (;). But it’s optional.
- JavaScript statements are the combination of ___________
         Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.

## Expressions:

- The statement and expression aren’t the same.
- An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes a single value. For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50, x*5
```javascript
const price = 500; 
```
  
Judging from the code above, const, price, =, and 500 are expressions  because each of them has a definite and unique meaning or value. 
But if we take all of them together const price = 500 - then we have a statement.
