###### Syntax
```javascript
condition ? expr1 : expr2
```
- `condition`: An expression that evaluates to `true` or `false`.
- `expr1`: The value that is returned if `condition` is `true`.
- `expr2`: The value that is returned if `condition` is `false`.
###### How It Works
The ternary operator evaluates the `condition`:
- If `condition` is `true`, it returns the value of `expr1`.
- If `condition` is `false`, it returns the value of `expr2`.

###### Basic Example
```javascript
let age = 18;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // "Yes"
```
###### Explanation
-  If `age` is 18 or more, the condition `age >= 18` is `true`, so `canVote` is set to `"Yes"`.
- If `age` were less than 18, the condition would be `false`, and `canVote` would be set to `"No"`.

### Using the Ternary Operator for Shorter Code
###### Traditional `if-else`
```javascript
let age = 18;
let canVote;

if (age >= 18) {
    canVote = "Yes";
} else {
    canVote = "No";
}

console.log(canVote); // "Yes"
```
###### Using Ternary Operator
```javascript
let age = 18;
let canVote = (age >= 18) ? "Yes" : "No";
console.log(canVote); // "Yes"
```

### Nesting Ternary Operators

###### Example
```javascript
let score = 85;
let grade = (score >= 90) ? "A" :
            (score >= 80) ? "B" :
            (score >= 70) ? "C" :
            (score >= 60) ? "D" : "F";

console.log(grade); // "B"
```
###### Explanation
- If `score` is 90 or more, `grade` is `"A"`.
- If `score` is between 80 and 89, `grade` is `"B"`.
- If `score` is between 70 and 79, `grade` is `"C"`.
- If `score` is between 60 and 69, `grade` is `"D"`.
- If `score` is less than 60, `grade` is `"F"`.

## Practical Use Cases
###### Assigning Default Values
```javascript
let user = null;
let userName = user ? user.name : "Guest";
console.log(userName); // "Guest"
```

###### Conditional Function Calls
```javascript
function greetUser(isMorning) {
    return isMorning ? "Good morning!" : "Good evening!";
}

console.log(greetUser(true));  // "Good morning!"
console.log(greetUser(false)); // "Good evening!"
```

----
### Readability Considerations
While the ternary operator can make your code more concise, overusing or nesting it deeply can reduce readability. For more complex conditions, a traditional `if-else` statement might be clearer.
