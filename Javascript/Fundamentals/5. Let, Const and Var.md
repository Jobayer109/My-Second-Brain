### Let
- **Definition**: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
  ```javascript
  let age = 30;
  age = 35; // Reassignable
  ```
###### `Notes:`
-  `let` cannot be Redeclared
-  `let` must be Declared before useÂ 
-  `let` have Block Scope
### const
- **Definition**: Declares a block-scoped constant that cannot be reassigned.
  ```javascript
  const PI = 3.14;
  // PI = 3.14159; // Error: Cannot reassign a constant
  ```

### `var`
- **Definition**: Declares a function-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
  ```javascript
  var count = 10;
  count = 15; // Reassignable
  ```



### Best Practices
- **Prefer `const`**: Use `const` by default for variables that won't be reassigned.
- **Fallback to `let`**: If a variable needs to be reassigned, use `let`.
- **Avoid `var`**: Unless working with legacy code or specific scenarios where `var` behavior is required.

### Declaration Without let, const, var
- When a variable is declared without `let`, `const`, or `var`, it becomes a global variable if declared in the global scope, or it becomes a property of the global object (`window` in browsers).
  ```javascript
  // Without let, const, var
  myGlobalVar = 42; // Creates a global variable
  console.log(window.myGlobalVar); // Accessible as a property of the global object
  ```

---
### Mutable vs. Immutable
- **Mutable**: Variables whose values can be changed after declaration (e.g., variables declared with `let`).
- **Immutable**: Variables whose values cannot be changed after declaration (e.g., variables declared with `const`).

##### `Explanation`
- **let**: Mutable; allows reassignment.
- **const**: Immutable; prohibits reassignment.
- **var**: Mutable; outdated, use `let` or `const` for clearer scoping.
